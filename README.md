# Big Head

A tiny little test Playdate game from the invite-only beta days.

## Building

Download the latest [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/) and extract it somewhere,
then symlink it to `~/playdate/PlaydateSDK-Current` (or just extract it there).

Build with the included Makefile; `make simulate` to run on the simulator and
`make install` to install to a connected device.

## Playing

Crank to inflate Nick's head and ascend.  Don't crank to descend.  Tilt to drift,
and use the left and right controls to kick your legs in that direction for a
quick burst of movement.

Your goal is to get to space, but don't touch anything along the way.

## Why though?

This was my first Playdate game, and I needed something simple to get started with.
